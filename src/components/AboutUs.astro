        The Coders Club was found by CSE Department who wanted to create a space
        for coders to connect and collaborate. Since then, we've grown into a
        vibrant community with several members. Our mission is to provide a
        supportive and inclusive environment for coders to learn, experiment,
        and build projects. We believe that coding is a powerful tool for
        creativity and problem-solving, and we're excited to share that passion
        with others. Our annual college-wide coding competition is a highlight
        of the year, and we take great pride in recruiting the best and
        brightest coders to our club. We believe that success in coding requires
        more than just technical skills, which is why we focus on developing
        strong analytical and problem-solving abilities in our members.
